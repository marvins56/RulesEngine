Certainly! Processing a large dataset in chunks is a common practice to handle memory constraints and improve performance. If you want to process the data in chunks, apply rules to each chunk, and then combine the flagged transactions to display them together, you can follow these steps:

Divide the Data into Chunks: Read the data in chunks (e.g., 10,000 transactions at a time) from the uploaded CSV or Excel file.

Apply Rules to Each Chunk: For each chunk, apply the selected rule to filter the flagged transactions.

Store Flagged Transactions: Append the flagged transactions from each chunk to a common DataFrame or list. You can also save them to separate files if needed.

Merge Flagged Transactions: After processing all chunks, combine all the flagged transactions into a single DataFrame. This will contain the flagged transactions from all chunks.

Display the Merged Result: Use the color_by_agent function to color the merged DataFrame by agent, and then display it using st.dataframe.

Here's a high-level code snippet to illustrate these steps:

python
Copy code
# Define an empty DataFrame to store flagged transactions from all chunks
all_flagged_transactions = pd.DataFrame()

# Read data in chunks and apply rules
chunksize = 10000
for chunk in pd.read_csv(uploaded_file, chunksize=chunksize):
    # Clean and preprocess the chunk
    chunk = clean_data(chunk)
    
    # Apply the selected rule to the chunk
    flagged_transactions_chunk = apply_selected_rule(chunk, selected_rule, time_window) # Implement this function to apply the rule
    
    # Append the flagged transactions from this chunk
    all_flagged_transactions = pd.concat([all_flagged_transactions, flagged_transactions_chunk])

# Display all flagged transactions together
st.subheader("All Flagged Transactions")
st.dataframe(color_by_agent(all_flagged_transactions))
